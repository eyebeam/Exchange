### Session 1: Understanding the Internet through Herbivore, led by Surya Mattu
_Curriculum and slides for the class will be shared here closer to the date of the event._

This workshop is ideal for those who are interested in learning how to packet sniff or learn what that even means. We will use [Herbivore](https://github.com/samatt/herbivore), an open source tool that demystifies the world of network packets for the uninitiated. A handful of packet sniffing libraries and desktop applications already exist for analyzing network packets, but they were designed for people who have programming experience or a network engineering background; they were not designed as educational tools for people without technical backgrounds. In this workshop we will go through the basics of what packet sniffing means, run through a few exercises and let you try it out.

#### Requirements
You will need a Mac to run Herbivore. Even if you don’t have a Mac, you’ll still learn a whole bunch. We encourage participants to work together and share computers.

#### Bio
[Surya Mattu](http://www.suryamattu.com/) is a Brooklyn based artist, engineer and investigative journalist who look at the ways in which algorithmic systems perpetuate systemic biases and inequalities in society. He is currently the data reporter at Gizmodo’s Special Projects Desk and a resident at Eyebeam. Previously, he was a contributing researcher at ProPublica, where he worked on Machine Bias, a series that aims to highlight how algorithmic systems can be biased and discriminate against people. Machine Bias was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for Explanatory Journalism. He has shown work at The Haus der Kulturen der Welt , Sundance Film Festival The Whitney Museum,  V&A Museum and Bitforms Gallery


### Session 2: Digital Activism, led by Ari Melenciano
_Curriculum and slides for the class will be shared here closer to the date of the event._

In this course we will build Twitter bots that can be used to engage users politically with tweets that reflect social injustices. This will be done through a text editor, such as [Atom](https://atom.io/), and using node.js. Goals of this course include teaching students how to “hack” social media for activist purposes, how to build personal APIs, how to build a Twitter bot, and gaining a basic understanding of coding.

#### Requirements
Basic programming knowledge, particularly in Javascript, would be helpful, but this will be an introductory session aimed at beginners.
