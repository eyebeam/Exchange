# Exchange
A series of monthly classes and workshops led by teaching artists. Our goal with the Exchange is to introduce curious learners to new subjects through tools, context and examples, providing enough insight so that students feel more comfortable exploring these topics after the workshop. You will walk away with more questions then you started and we hope you are as excited about that as we are.

Each class listed below links to a page that contains the syllabus, slides and a recorded video of the session.

### June 16, 2018 - Online Communities, Offline 
Explore the use of technology to serve offline communities by making networked, sensor collecting, wifi enabled talismans in a Little Juju workshop led by Ayodamola Okunseinde and and Wiena Lin. Intro by Dhruv Mehrotra to the Othernet, a local network based in Bushwick, enabling neighbors to browser and create “web” content. 

The Little JuJu collection is comprised of a home station (Heart) and wearable “Talismans” that record and respond to the wearer’s behavior and environment via input and output systems of visualization, sonification, haptics, and ancestral divination. Sensor data is shared via the Internet with other Juju collections, thus mapping a network of Little Juju wearers. This activated network supports a novel structure to respond to the shifting global socio-political landscape by facilitating collaborative arts and experiences that grow, change, and sustain modern tribes into the future.
